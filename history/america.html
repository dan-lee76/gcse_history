	<li class="basic" id="FMID_806721254FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Wind Pumps: This enabled them to get water stored from underground. This used the earths natural resources instead of doing it by hand. This was known as self regulating. However it did take year before it was wide spread.

      Cattle Industry: There were too many cattle therefore the prices dropped due to the oversupply of beef and there was little grass left due to overgrazing. This ment there was less profit and some went bankrupt. Winter of 1886-87 meant 15% of cattle died due to the freezing temperatures and deep snow.

      Plain Indians
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1155124514FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Tribe structure: Indian tribes were split into four categories.
    </p><p>
      Bands: Indians knew each other. Survival and protection of band was more important than individual.(Village)
    </p><p>
      Chiefs: Head of bands, full of wisdom and warriors. Decide where their bands would go.(Mayor)
    </p><p>
      Tribes: Bands in a tribe, would support one another. Discuss issues and trade. Chiefs and elders formed the tribal councils.(County)
    </p><p>
      Warrior Societies: Best warriors from each band formed. Members would supervise hunting and protection of band. Raids would be discussed and organised.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_115286969FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Chiefs and Leadership: Unlike American society, everyone council memeber had to agree to it. The rest of the tribe did not have to obey the decision. The Cheifs and Elderly were guided by the spirit.
    </p><p>
      Everyone was equally important. Men(braves) would hunt and fought enemies. Women(squaws) made clothing, fed family and looked after the tipi. Everyone would look after children and the elderly were respected with their wisdom.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1781681641FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Survival on the Plains: The Great Plains was a great big dry desert. Not much could grow there. In the winter it would be too cold, and the summer it would be too dry. The soil wanst great either. Therefore Indians had to rely on animals and one another. Buffalo and Horses were key in their survival.
    </p><p>
      The Indians adopted a nomadic(traveling) lifestyle. This was so they could follow the Buffalo everywhere they go. In the summer they would have tipis, which were strong and had a good shape to block off the harsh wind of the west. They were also very portable. In the winter, the Indians would go to a valley where they would be protected, and would have wooden huts, with strong insulation so they can survive in the harsh winter.
    </p><p>
      Bands always split up on the plains as food became scarce. The size depended on the amount of food available. They would invade and attack over tribes to steal food, people and horses. This was the best way of a chance of surviving on the planes.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1888548148FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Buffalo: They were their God and spirit. The Indians worshiped and prayed for Buffalo. It was there main food source and used for everything. Nothing of the Buffalo was waisted. The skin was used for clothing or the tipi, and the meat to be eaten. Other parts of the body was used, nothing was put to waste. Apart from the heart. They left that where they killed the Buffalo as it was thought it gave life to a new herd.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_847934951FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Horses: They were vital for the Indians to survive. Without them they would be unable to survive on the plains due to the great distance and needed a fast mode of transport to catch up with the buffalo. The horses came from the Spanish when they invaded. The wealth and strength of the tribe depended on how many horses they had and how much they could carry. When they moved, all of the Indians belongings would be placed onto the horses and carried with them. They would use the horses to follow the herd of Buffalo. The Indians never settle somewhere permanently. They always followed the Buffalo.
    </p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1593522653FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Beliefs: The Indians had various beliefs. This consisted of nature, land and property, and towards war.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1886136937FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Nature: They believed every thing in nature had a spirit. These were either to help or harm humans. They believed you should work with the spirits not control or tame them. The spirits would help if you needed it. They also thought that you could contact them by doing a special ritual dances.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_362735018FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Land and Property: Indians had sacred areas. This was due to them believing their original tribe originated from that area. They believed that no one could own land, that land was no ones property, it was just out there for people to use.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1102667831FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      War: Plain Indians were full of conflict. But they tried to kill young men and women as they were essential to the tribe. There was great respect given to warriors who were young and got a blow from an enemy but walked a way without any injuries. Indian war parties would run away from a fight if it turned against them. This therefore made the us army find it hard to fight the Indians and how to therefore come up with new tactics.
    </p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1813163153FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      US Government Policy: The US government needed whites to go west to live and claim the new territories. This therefore ment that people would have to cross Indian land. The US forced Indians to move away from trails to whites to get to the west.
    </p><p>
      With the permanent Indian Frontier in place, the Indians were restricted to a certain area of the desert. This stopped whites from going into the territory, but it did mean that the Indians were trapped in and could no longer go east of the Mississippi river.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1504063054FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Indian Appropriation Act 1851: The US wanted land which they gave to Indians. Reservations were the way forward. They paid Indians to move onto smaller bits of land called reservations. Later on the Indians hated these as they were much smaller than they had before and their nomadic way of life was drastically changing. The Indian Appropiation Act paid for them to move, as well as making sure whites and Indians were separated in fear that the Indians could harm the whites. They hoped when Indians moved onto reservations they would be able to adopt a farming life style and start to become like white people. They also hoped whites could teach them new skills and a new way of life.
    </p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li>

		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1720835667FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Encouraging Migration: There were many economic benefits of moving west. The land was much cheaper than anywhere else and you would get loads of it. With the gold rush, there was a chance of you being able to get gold. It didn't cost much to move, you could either use a train or use your own way. The government were even giving you money to send you west through the homesteaders act. Due to the unemployment rates increasing, and a lack of jobs, especially the banks going bust, people wanted a new life a new chapter, so moving west was great as they could restart their life.
    </p></div>

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1262629018FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Manifest Destiny: With the US needing settlers in the west, encouraging them was a bit difficult. Hence they created the Manifest Destiny concept. This was that Gods will wanted white Americans to settle over America instead of someone else. At the time people accepted this due to it being right and natural and from God.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1087795387FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font face="SansSerif">Oregon Trail: The journey west was difficult but with the Oregon trail it made it easier for them to get across. With the US funding for exploration maps, and guides, the Oregon trail was born. It originally was there, but not many people were aware of it, but due to the advertisements, people were willing to try and cross it. With these trailers it made it safe from Indian attacks and it assured them that they wouldn’t get lost. But there were a few issues with it. If they didn’t complete the journey by winter, they risk getting stuck in the mountains and die. Another issue was the great American desert. It was empty, and it didn’t have much water. Extreme heat, sandstorms and a lack of supplies meant nature you take them and destroy them. The trails also went over mountains, which meant settlers wagons had to be strong and sturdy to ensure they can get through the mountains safely. <o p="#DEFAULT" face="SansSerif" /></font></p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_201893302FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p><font face="SansSerif">Gold Rush 1849: The gold rush encouraged people to migrate west to due the benefit of finding gold and gaining money, considering they could have lost everything due to the banks going bust. Thousands of people migrated west in hope of finding gold. But this brought consequence to people. The Indians had less land now the whites were taking control of it, and California becoming a state. There were tensions and lawlessness in the camps and there were many racial tensions due to the immigrations of Chinese people.</font></p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_886174312FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Process Migrating West: When migrating west people had to think about who they went with and the equipment and supplies they would take. They could only take so much with them if not they would go extremely slow. They would have to carry their personal belongings and vital items for a chance of survival. They also had to have sturdy wagons and tuff animals to pull their items.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_32787038FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font size="12.0pt" face="SansSerif">Problems with Migration: Migrating west had a few problems. It rose tensions with the Indians, who weren’t happy, and who lived a nomadic lifestyle, were now enclosed in a certain region. Another problem was the success rate wasn’t high. Moving west needed planning, and if you went on your won, there was risk of death. This was due to there being no doctors if there was a disease going around on the trail. There wasn’t much water, so people who must fight and share for supplies. There were a lot of problems which occurred for settlers trying to migrate west.</font></p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1307854460FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Donner Party: A party led by Jacob and George Donner. They left Missouri for California in May 1846 with 60 wagons and 300 people. The wagon train was well equipped but it had more women than men. At fort Bridger a small group of 80 decided to take a short cut, known as Hastings Cutoff. Four wagons broke, 300 cattle died and a few killed one another. They arrived late to Nevada and were trapped by heavy snow. A group was sent to help them, it took 32 days to reach them in Johnsons Ranch. To survive both the groups would have to eat one another.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_969183517FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font size="12.0pt" face="SansSerif">Mormon Migration: Joseph Smith was the leader of the religion Mormons. He stated he was inspired by God, and his public speaking brought attention and the religion grew. However, the public didn’t like the Mormons, so they killed their leader. They kept moving from state to state until they decided to migrate west to Salt Lake. Their new leader was Brigham Young. He split people into different groups and decided to send out an advance party who could ensure there was enough water on route and there were crossings a river. This ensured their safety. Brigham Young taught them how they should migrate west, in groups with people who have different traits, e.g., doctor, builder, carpenter, farmer, warrior. He also taught them how to make a circle with their wagons, so they were protected at night time. When they reached Salt Late, they were alone, but safe. The mountains helped them survive and were able to get away from persecution. Especially as Salt Lake was out of the US.</font><font size="12.0pt" face="Times New Roman,serif"> <o p="#DEFAULT" /></font></p></div></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_985116439FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Farming: In the plains, the only way to survive was to farm. But even then it was hard and tough to farm in the west.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_254153530FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Problems: There were many problems in the west which didn't help with farming, this included:
    </p><ul><li>
        Climate - Very hot, dry summers, very cold winters
      </li><li>
        Grasshoppers - Plagues and pests
      </li><li>
        Weather - Thunderstorms and violent winds
      </li><li>
        Lack of Timber - No trees anywhere for building, fencing or fuel
      </li><li>
        Thick Sod - Tangled mass of grass roots meaning they couldn't grow anything
      </li><li>
        Lack of water - Plants and animals require water to grow and survive. There was barely any water in the West.
      </li></ul><p>
      Crops which grew in the west no longer could in the west due to lack of water, or would be eaten up by insects.
    </p><p>
      Ploughs broke due to the thick sod. They therefore had to use a spade with damage their health due to the harsh labour and strain it put onto their back.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_499898633FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Development: Due to there being no timber, the settlers were unable to build a house. They therefore had to come up with a different way of building them. They decided to use the sod they digged up. This was good and the walls were good for insulation in the winter. The roof made it cool and was fireproof. But inside the house it would be dirty and infested with insects.
    </p></div></li></ul></li></ul></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1341177440FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p><b>Conflict and tension</b></p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_643725093FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Reasons for tension: With the expansion of more whites moving west the Indians concerns about the impact of their resources. The Indians also become worried about their land, as they were no longer allowed to roam around it, like their nomadic life style. Due to this there was conflict over the whites claiming land or resources which was originally the Indians. Indians would sometimes attack the whites who were using the Oregon trail for resources that other people had took off from them. This therefore resulted into the Fort Laramie Treaty
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1963552222FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal"><font size="12.0pt" face="SansSerif">Significance of Fort Laramie: With the treaty, there were many pros and cons to it. There were territories set out for the Plains Indians, so they knew where they would be safe and where whites shouldn't settle. White settlers were allowed in Indian territories, so they could pass through them if it would speed up their route. Railroad surveyors and military posts in Indian territories meant the expansion of the west was quicker and covered a larger area. The railroad would be able to get passengers to the west cost for as cheaply and quickly as possible. Tribes were to receive resources from the us government to help them from their loss. But this meant the Indians would have to rely on them. With the treaty, Indians signed they would get $50,000 a year. This would be used in the future against the Indians. This meant Indians would depend on the government for food, therefore losing their independence. The government started to prioritise the whites over the Indians. Taking back what they had once promised to the Indians, therefore completely ignoring the previous acts, and just focusing on whites instead of Indians. They would do anything to ensure the whites were happy.</font></p></div></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1580357574FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Lawlessness: The wild west was very lawless. There was no one to enforce the law, and no one to stop it. There were many social issues, related to alcohol, gambling and prostitution. There were also new crimes like claim jumping(where someone takes land which isn't theirs). Gold camps had many issues. There would be fights all the time, over cards, women and gold. There was a lot of prejudiced against Chinese immigrants and other race. Miners who made money also got targeted. There was no one able to stop them.

      San Francisco gangs: Loads of people moved there in hope of gold, but as there wasn't any gold, it soon field with unemployed people. As the Chinese came, racial tensions increased. By 1851 the gangs were out of control, and the local police couldn't control them. As there was no effective law enforcement, the public set up a vigilance committee to control the gang. This idea soon spread elsewhere.

        Deputy Marshals: Appointed to large towns
      </li><li>
        Town marshals: Deal with local outbreaks
      </li><li>
        Sheriffs: Look after the counties
      </li></ul><p>
      The US was in charge of everything until it became its own state, where it could have its own laws. There would be people in charge of that county and after 5,000 settlers, they could appoint a sheriff. The US struggled to take control over the US due to its large size. They didn't spend much money in law enforcement as they mainly wanted to expand their territory.

      Civil War: This changed America. It led to a new wave of settlers west. Before the Civil War, south and north America were divided. The north would have small population with no slaves, but in the south it consisted of a large population and a large amount of slaves. A consequence of the war was the Homestead Act of 1862.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1079677595FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      The impact: The south often resented the victorious US government and its laws. Young men found it difficult to fit into society due to them being traumatised by the war. Many people were now unemployed.
    </p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_689903767FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Homestead Act 1862: This encouraged family owners to move west due to the cheap amount of land the US were offering. The whites would be able to claim 160 acres of land, for $10 and then if they showed proof they worked on the land if 5 years time they would keep it forever for $30 more. This made the population and expansion of the west massive. This had a big impact in the land people owned but it came with some limitations. This included it being the plains soil, which ment it was terrible to use and grow with.

	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1366183104FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Pacific Railroad Act 1862: The was the act granted the build of the enormous transcontinental railroad. The government would pay the railroad company for every mile of track layed. The railroad also got a lot of free land with it.
    </p></div>

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1691305417FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      First Transcontinental Railroad: This was a huge advantage for the whites as they were now able to get to the west cheapily, safley and quickly. No longer would they have to spend a year getting to the west, and running the risk of dying. They could now do it in a week. This brought a huge amount of settlers to the west, as it started to become more attractive. With this the railroads now started to do deals, with the land and ticket. The railroads advertised this outside America aswell.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_104396662FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Development: The railroad started to spread across America with different lines and routes
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1668893132FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Law &amp; order: The railroads brought new towns and cow towns on the route. But as the railroad was being used more often it brought trouble. This was known as 'Hell on Wheels'. There was no law enforcement in these towns, so there was heavy drinking, gambling and prostitution. This brought train robbers to the trains due to valuables being transported by the trains.
    </p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_420233391FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Solutions for problems: There were many problems which settlers had to over come:
    </p><ul><li>
        No water - Drill holes, so wind powered
      </li><li>
        Lack of timber - Sod houses
      </li><li>
        Bad land - Dry farming and new machinary
      </li><li>
        Land goldings too small for a family - Timber Culture Act 1873<u> </u>Let homesteaders have 160 more acres of land if they promised to plant trees on half of it. Desert Land Act 1877 - Let settlers buy 640 acres of desert land cheaply.
      </li></ul></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1257386232FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Tracking Lawlessness: It continued throughout settlements, but with the development of railroads and electric telegraph, communication between law enforcements and the federal government improved. However new settlements were left to deal with it themselves. However they would still elect sheriffs and town marshals. They were now enforced the law by personality, but gangs were still sometimes too powerful to control.

      Cattle Industry: With the civil war happening, the cows got very busy and had loads of babies as no one was looking after them. When people got back, they realised they had a lot of cows, and they didn't know what todo to them. Selling cows in the south was bad as it didn't make them anymore due to the amount of beef there already was. They therefore decided to travel north and sell the beef to the north as they were paying a lot of money for some beef.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1187825035FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Cow Towns: Abilene was the first cow town. This was set up by Joseph McCoy. This would be where cowboys would drive their cattle up to, and then sell it to business men. This was good as some cow towns were connected to the railroad. The cowboy would get paid and waste the money on alcohol in the local saloons.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1049326090FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Goodnight-Loving Trail: Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving realised there were more markets to sell the cattle to than just texas, the west. The first trail opened it 1866, which was to Fort Sumner. In 1868 it extended up to Colorado and Wyoming, which connected to the Union Pacific Railroad.

      John Iliff: Sell meat to booming towns. Saw an opportunity to raise cattle on the Plains and began ranching near Denver in 1866. He became Denvers first millionaire for selling his beef to miners, Indians and railroad worker gangs. By 1870 he had 26000 cattle over a ranch of 16000
    </p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1270225128FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Cowboys: Mostly young men who would drive the cattle to their destination. They were tough and hardworking, and hard drinking. Life could be lonely and worked between 12-24 hours a day.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1624864822FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Trails: Work was seasonal, work by branding, driving and rounding them up. They looked out for sick and stuck cattle. They would sleep in open air and cooked on campfires.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_997133105FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Ranches: All year round and full time. Worked included branding, rounding up, cattle work and looking after, fencing. Would sleep in bunkhouses and used cook houses. Many couldn't survive due to the ban of weapons, gambling, drinking. These jobs were rare as not many were needed.
    </p></div></li></ul></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_316368771FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Ranchers vs Homesteaders: Ranchers would do sneaky tricks to get land. They would buy the land, near public land - it was legal for everyone to pasture livestock on public land - and fence around it. Making public land unaccessible for people, so they cant claim it. Fencing was another issues as they believed it was the other ones fault and they should pay for it. That cattle should be allowed to roam but not on the farm. Mixed views.

      Railroads: This effected the Buffalo due to them being blocked, killed by the railroads and the noise. The Indians didn't like this as this lead to extinction of the buffalo. Railroads also encouraged settlement which got rid of the Indians land.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_522188093FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Cattle Industry: Buffalo competed for the same grass as the cattle. Buffalo herds were put under pressure with the growth of cattle. The trails also went through some of the Indian land. The fencing of land also disrupted the Buffalo, confiding them to a certain space.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1132796608FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Gold Rush: With the gold rush, whites would go onto the Indians land and sacred places. They would dig up the area in hope of finding gold. There was a lot of trespassing due to this.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1039214795FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Reservations: The government encouraged Indians to go onto reservations. This was due to them prommising protection, and supply of foods. Reservations were made smaller so the Indians could no longer hunt. The 'Bureau of Indian Affairs' was corrupt and cheated on Indians.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_840556676FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
