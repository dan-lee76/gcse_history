      Views: The Nazis view on women wasn't new. They wanted to reverse all of the work of the Weimar Republic to women. They wanted to change how they vote, work and live. They believed they should become natural and focus on having a family more than anything. They would have to focus on the ideas of KKK - Kinder, Kuche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church)
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_922081810FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Policies: They believed women should not work, even in professional, hence why many jobs were lost and replaced by men. They did not like this. The Nazis also did marriage loans which were used for newly married couples. This made the women stop working and sometimes have kids. They would also pay the parents one-quarter of their payments for each child they had. They also ran clubs and gave out medals for having children. The German Womens Enterprice had 6 million members suggesting they adopted the Nazis.

      Legacy of First World War: 2 million troops died and over 4 million were injured. Germany was in debt of 150 million marks. On the 9th November 1918 Philipp Scheidemann  announced Germany was a Rebublic. This was due to a revolution and the Kaiser being abdicate. The revolution continued until August 1919 when the Weimar Republic was established.

	<li class="exp" id="FMID_1534917391FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Weimar Constitution: People would vote, women and men over 21. They would vote for Head of state every 7 years. (Could suspend the constitution and pass laws by decree. Would choose chancellor.) Every 4 years would vote for Reichstag and Reichsrat. (Reichstag was big parliament and controlled everything) (Reichsrat was represented the regions of Germany.) The chancellor and cabinet would be decided. (Chancellor was the head of the government and chose all of the government ministers.) (Cabinet was the main decision-making body.)
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_945670824FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Strengths: Small parties would get a say due to proportional representation. Women could vote and voting age was reduced from 25 to 21. No one or group could have too much power. Reichstrat could regulate the power of the reichstag by delaying new laws.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1387553717FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Weaknesses: Found it difficult to form a coalition. Found it hard to have strong policies and often fell apart. Lack of government led to weakness. The president could pass laws using article 48 without the Reichstag. Was not the choice of people.

		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_981408458FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Treaty of Versailles: Germany had to pay £6600 million yearly to the allies to repair damage to their countries. The army was now limited to 100,000. The navy was now limited. They were unable to have a air force and no military was allowed in the land bordering France. Article 231 of the TOV also stated Germany was guilty of starting the war, however many Germans did not like this as they believed it was self defence. Germany also lost a lot of land
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_41819069FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1437175706FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Challenges from the left: This was the Spartacist revolt. In January 1919 Spartacists (left wing who had soviet backing) took over government newspapers and telegraph bureau. They tried to organise a strike in Berlin. They tried to put them down with Freikorps(right-wing, ex-soldiers who kept their weapons)
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_801192677FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Challenges from the Right: This was the Kapp putsch. In march 1920, Freikorps troops, fearing unemployment, they went on strike in Berlin. As the government fled in fear, they made the trade unions go on strike which caused chaos that the Kapp could not rule Germany and was forced to flee.

      Causes: They printed more money to pay off the war, but they didn't have enough gold. They kept printing. The Ruhr occupation occurred in January 1923. French troops invaded and took resources to pay for reparations due to Germany not paying. The government made the workers go on strike to the French wouldn't take 80% of Germany industry. The government kept printing money to pay the workers. The mark became worthless.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1966001659FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Effects: Some people could not afford food. The wages didn't rise as quick as the inflation. Savings were gone and business went bankrupt. People kept blaming the Weimar republic. However farmers benefited as they got paid more for the food. Fixed rent and mortgages were paid off quickly. Foreign visitors could buy more with their money.
