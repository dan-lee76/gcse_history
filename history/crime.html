      Changes: The bloody code reached a peak of 222 in 1810, however the government realised that deterrence was not working. They therefore decided to change punishments to fit the crimes. This meant that the punishment would be equal to the crime committed. Punishments would also try different methods, such as prisons. They were considering to do rehabilitate people, so they become better people. They also realised that capital and corporal punishments should only be used for the most serious of crimes. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Transportation: America decided to go independent, this therefore meant England was unable to send criminals. They had to find a new place, Australia. This made people more feared of getting this punishment as at the time people thought the world was flat, therefore they would fall of. People didn’t want to go there as well as it was an unexplored land. They didn’t know how big it worse nor what it looked like. However, in 1868 transportation ended for several reasons. Australia no longer needed labour as it had people who wanted to do it and they didn’t want any criminals. People were starting to stay after their sentence as Australia was offering better thing that England did. The gold rush made it become a desirable place, so people were starting to commit a crime, so they can get a free ticket. Transportation was also very expensive and there were better, and cheaper alternatives. Prisons were starting to be used more often so Transportation just become worthless and not feasible. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Penal Code: Robert Peel wasn’t happy with there being a lot of capital punishments during the bloody code. Therefore, he changed the amount of punishments down to 100. This was because Judges weren’t giving out many punishments and they thought it was unfair someone should die for doing a small petty crime. Robert changed this so Judges would punish criminals more, as they wouldn’t have to receive the death penalty. This reformed criminals and there were now less harsh punishments in place. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Prison Reform: Due to the prison reformers, Robert wanted to get some acts past, he thereofre was able to get the 1823 Gaols Act through parliment. There were no inspectors so enforcing the act was limited. <i>See Crime&gt;Prison&gt;John Howard</i></p></div></li>

    Met Police Act 1829: This was the first time a paid police force was set up. This was a centralised police force which brought various views. At first people hated the police as they thought the government was spying on them and their freedom was taken away from them. But as time went on they soon accepted the police as agreed to it. The amount of crime being found was good. The police were usually unarmed and were trained to use minimal physical force. They were focused on patrolling areas where there was high crime rate. Members had uniform, so they could be identified but didn’t look like soldiers. They were carefully trained, and only certain recruits were enrolled

      The Beat: This was a route which police officers would patrole. This was to deter and stop crime. They would ask people what they were doing and why. However, this wasn't always good as criminals would be able to find the route the police would take and the time, and avoid that area when the police officer was there.

      Police Recruits: Most officers came from outside London due to the good pay it offered. Most had backgrounds in farm work or labouring. There would sometimes be problems with absenteeism and drinking on the job. In 1885 the police had 13,319 police to serve over 5 million people. Only 1383 were on duty at a time.

      Attitudes: People hated the police as they believed the government were trying to spy on them. Hence revolts came. The working class believed the police only worked for the middle and upper classes. The economic depression lead to hatred of the police.

      Housing: There were many problems with housing in Whitechapel. There were overcrowding and the sanitary was awful. Lodging houses were where people would pay for a night for a bed, and access to a kitchen. Rookeries were slum areas, where most people lived, and the conditions were not great at all. There was some support with housing such as George Peabody. He tried to improve the living conditions by building 11 blocks of flats where a slum once was and having low cost. It opened in 1881, but people still struggled to pay for the flat. <o p="#DEFAULT" /></p></div></li>

      Provision for the poor: This included workhouses, but they were seen as a last resort. They offered a bed and food for harsh labour. But many people didn’t go there as families would be split up, and it was hard to leave the workhouse as you wouldn’t have anywhere else to go, and it was worse that prison. After 1880 many orphans were cared for in Barnardo’s homes, where conditions were better.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_363492998FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Unemployment: There was a lack of employment in Whitechapel due to the economic depression it brought. People would work for long hours in factories for low pay, known as sweated trades. It was crammed and dirty. The building railways and docks, but work was limited. Another problem was Jews. They migrated from Poland and Russia, and took most of the jobs. They didn't care how much they got paid, and were able to work more as Sunday wasn't their holy day, so they could work all the time.

      Environment and Crime: Overcrowding led to tensions between residents. High level of prostitution that led to violence in women. Low income ment people were unable to escape the trouble area of Whitechapel. People would steal to survive. The work was unreliable that meant people had a lot of spare time, which lead to alcoholism, disruptive behaviour and violence.

    Irish Immigration: Many Irish people tried to leave Ireland due to famine and wanting a better life. But when they left the America, they couldn’t afford it and ended up in London. Due to them being poor, they were unable to live in expensive areas, so they had to live in the cheapest. Most of them were navvies, so they took all the constructive work away. They had a reputation for being drunk and causing violence due to associated terrorism such as the Fenians.

      Population: The population in Whitechapel kept changing, which meant accommodation was temporary, therefore no community was involved as people wouldn't care as they would be leaving shortly.

      Eastern European immigrants: 1880s saw a big increase in Russian and Polish Jews who fled from persecution. Poverty ment they would only be able to live in the cheaper areas. They tended to stay together, causing segregation. Some parts of Whitechapel was just Jews.

      Sailors: With Whitechapel being a port, sailors would stop off for a few weeks and take advantage of the local amenities. They would get drunk a lot, causing violence within Whitechapel, they would use prostitutes and stay in nearby lodging or on their boat. This created business but at the same time brought strain onto the police and changed how Whitechapel was portrayed.

      Anarchists and Socialists: Waves of attempted revolutions occurred. Many of the revolutionaries ended up in Londons East End. Movement by them were anarchism, who opposed the government and believed it would be better without them. Socialism was spreading in hope of ending capitalism. Both were feared by the authorities, upper and middle classes. They were attracted to some people in Whitechapel.

      Tensions: There were resulting tensions with immigrants and resident over who should get access or housing and jobs. Increase in the sweatshop system was due to the Jews. Anti-Semitism and violence agains Jews was increasing. Anyone with a foreign accent was suspected of being violent. They were also blamed for many crimes, including the Ripper murders. This increased race hatred and violence towards them.

      H Division: The metropolitan police were divided into different divisions around London. Whitechapel's division was 'H'. They had a set route to follow for each patrol, known as the beat. They looked out the trouble and they had to sign a book of their location at different times. If they didn’t get to a point at a certain time, the police would start looking for them as they would know an incident had occurred. They did have difficulties as criminals would be able to outsmart them. They were also hated by the public.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="exp" id="FMID_353052678FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Difficulties of Policing: The police had many issues to overcome in Whitechapel. They had to try and get the public to trust them, whilst being able to deal with crime and the Ripper murders. Let alone most of the crime in Whitechapel was due to prostitution or alcohol.
    </p></div>
		<ul class="sub">
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_660822653FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Gangs: Large professional groups would be gangs. They would employ highly skill and trained men to be part of them. They would cause all king of trouble, and some ran the sweated trade, so when workers wanted a pay rise they would have to deal with the gangs. This was a threat to the police as there were more gangs than policemen. If a gang approached a police officer, he would be outnumbered, and being unarmed, it is unlikely he could get away safely.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_570053409FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Violent demonstrations: Large amount of people would protest, which would lead to the police attacking them and then leading to a mass violence. This was hard for the police, as it had to recruit extra staff to deal with this trouble, and if the police had the same views of the protest, what would happen?
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_237238566FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Attacks on Jews: With the Jewish immigration, residence of Whitechapel would occasionally attack them due to the Jews taking away their homes or stealing all of the jobs, due to them working for less and working on Sundays. Some police were anti-Semitic, but one of the main issues was the language barrier which prevented others from catching the attacker, and the police being able to communicate to them.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_264942435FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Protection Rackets: Gangs demanded 'protection money' from businesses to 'protect' them. If they didn't the property would be destroyed by the gang. Fear rose up quickly due to these gangs, and people didn't report it to the police, therefore the police were unaware, and couldn't help the public. Even if someone did report it, the police were unaware to the extent it was.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_873292728FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Alcohol: Whitechapel had many pubs and gin houses. They sold very strong alcohol for very cheap. Many people turned in alcoholics which then lead to violent crime.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1943500699FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Prostitution: With many jobs being taken by other people, such as Jews and many, women resulted to the last resort. Prostitution. By 1888 there were 1200 prostitutes who were vulnerable to violence.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_284755481FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Environment: Whitechapel was connected by dark and narrow alleys. The police weren't always able to get down there, and it was away from the busy streets of Whitechapel. Violent acts would happen down the alleys. Their were multiple doorways into rookies with packed people, so escape from the police was easy. Chasing criminals was extremely hard.

	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1065611563FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Whitechapel Vigilace Committee 1888: This was set up by businessmen in Whitechapel due to the police being unable to find the Ripper murders. They would offer rewards for any information leading to the capture of the murder. They would patrol streets at night with torches and whistles. This disrupted the police investigation, but also hampered the police by sending them false information, which then sent criticism of the police in newspapers

      Developments in techniques: Over time, the police used new techniques of investigation, these improved and helped the police find evidence and prosecute criminals. This included:
    </p><ul><li>
        House to house searches for evidence
      </li><li>
        Distributing leaflets and advertising in newspapers appealing for information from the public
      </li><li>
        Following up clues found or not found at the crime scenes
      </li><li>
        Following up evidence from the bodies detailed by post mortems and coroners reports
      </li><li>
        Detailed annotated sketches of the crime scenes were drawn and photographs taken
      </li><li>
        Setting up soup kitchens to encourage the poorest to come forward with information
      </li><li>
        Interviewing witnesses or suspects including those provided by tip-offs
      </li></ul></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_58376463FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Improvements: The Met introduced Bertillon system of taking measurements and photographs of the suspects. By 1900s they introduced telephones which improved the speed of police communication.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_586530730FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Problems: There was a lack of communication and great rivalry between the Met and City of London police forces. They didn’t share information, they wanted to solve crimes before the other one did. This mainly happened during the Ripper murders and Whitechapel overlapped both police forces. There was also conflict with CID and Scotland Yard.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_267759197FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      Jack the Ripper: Between 31st August and 9th November 1888, 5 women were killed in Whitechapel. The name Jack The Ripper was given due to the name on some letters. But they are still unable to solve the Ripper murders.
    </p></div></li>
	<li class="basic" id="FMID_1244314544FM"><div class="nodecontent"><p>
      The Media: They caused a big problem for the police as they were unable to get any real information from the public. It brought hoax letters and loads of theories on the identity of the killer. It also brought shame to the police, convincing the public that a 'Englishman' wouldn't have caused any awful crimes. This led to violence for the police to deal with as foreigners got angry for discrimination.
